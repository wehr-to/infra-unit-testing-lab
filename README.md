# ðŸ§ª infra-unit-testing-lab

This repository explores **unit testing in infrastructure and automation workflows** â€” ensuring that what we provision, configure, or secure behaves as expected *before* it hits production.

While often overlooked in DevOps or security engineering, unit testing is the gold standard in software â€” and this repo applies that mindset to Terraform, Ansible, Bash, Python, and CI/CD environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo Exists

Most infrastructure teams validate through hope and rollback. This project proves you can:

- Write **unit tests** for your provisioning logic
- Use **mock inputs** to simulate various infra states
- Assert that security, tags, configs, and compliance rules are enforced
- Integrate these checks into pipelines and automated workflows

## ðŸ§± Whatâ€™s Covered

| Area                  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `terraform-tests/`     | Unit tests using `terratest` and `infracost` assertions |
| `ansible-tests/`       | Role and task-level tests using `molecule` and `testinfra` |
| `bash-tests/`          | Shell script testing with `bats-core` |
| `python-tests/`        | Infra automation logic tested with `pytest` |
| `ci-integration/`      | GitHub Actions and pre-commit test runners |
| `mock-data/`           | Sample inputs and fixture files for local testing |
| `docs/`                | Examples, reasoning, and test philosophy |

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Frameworks Used
- Terratest (Go)
